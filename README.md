### Question 1

## Task 1: The Five V's

1. Different Data Types: The dataset many types of measurements. e.g the record with sensor_id: "AQ-01-GER" measures air quality in AQI units, while sensor_id: "HUM-01-GER" measures humidity in percentage (%).

2. Velocity: for better system performance, if not managed efficiently high-velocity data from thousands of sensors can overwhelm systems.

3. Veracity: data_source_veracity field represents the confidence level
it ensures data is accurate and reliable
sensor_id: "TC-05-GER" and timestamp: "2025-07-29T08:46:15Z" has a data_source_veracity: null

4. Volume: storage and processing power issues

5. Value: give insights to improve urban planning and public health in Germiston.
administrators can identify congestion hotspots and suggest alternate routes via a Smart City app

 ## Task 2: Data Quality Assessment

1. Data quality refers to the degree to which data is accurate, complete, consistent, timely, and relevant, enabling it to serve its intended purpose effectively.

2. Inconsistent Timestamp Format - complicate data processing
Missing or Invalid Data Values - makes it hard to understand whats going on
Missing Data Type - data.type: null - also makes it hard to understand whats going on

   ## Task 3: Data Governance & Security

2. Data Breach disadvantages
-gives competition the upper hand as they can copy you 
damages reputation as clients will lose data and make company seem like they untustworthy and stuff

3. data manager - understand data sensitivity as is qualified to handle this stuff
